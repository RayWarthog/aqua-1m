I also really felt the love Aqua-chan had towards the Aqua Crew in Aqua-Iro Pallete. In addition, I admire Aqua-chan's persistence towards her goals, such as her APEX SOLO DIAMOND CHALLENGE and SMASH CLOUD VIP 耐久, even when things seemed to be going badly. This year, I look forward to more of Aqua-chan's streams, even beyond 1 million subscribers!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AKUKIN建設最高!!!! AKUKIN建設への栄光あれ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

The moment you caught me was when you were playing Apex Legends I saw you were really good on gaming and have a nice voice that's why I subscribe to you.

Your fan,
